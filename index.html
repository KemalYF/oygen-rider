                <p>
                    Living all alone kinda forgot it's been that long<br>
                    Since someone's gone<br>
                    I've been trying to be a little bit strong<br>
                    And it is not that easy to be exactly who I was<br>
                    My shit is done<br>
                    Now it's time for me try to moving on<br>
                    'Cause if you think I'm such a happy person, no<br>
                    You are wrong by saying my laughter is<br>
                    Louder than yours, shut your freakin' mouth<br>
                    No one knows what I feel and what I suffer<br>
                    No they dont know, so keep your thoughts<br>
                    And stop assuming that, someone is always fine<br>
                    <br>
                    I keep thinking why my friends left me<br>
                    I can go insane<br>
                    Mom was right about that and now I can't trust again<br>
                    But I think I don't really need no<br>
                    Friends I'm alone and it's not that bad<br>
                    Then again it hurts me so bad and people just don't know that<br>
                    <br>
                    Maybe this time, I'ma take back what is mine<br>
                    All the smiles, all the joys are still mine (are still mine)<br>
                    There will be no more cryin'<br>
                    There will be no more tryin'<br>
                    These places I never belong<br>
                    'Cause this guy now is gone<br>
                    <br>
                    If you think I'm such a happy person, no<br>
                    You are wrong by saying my laughter is<br>
                    Louder than yours, shut your freakin mouth<br>
                    No one knows what I feel and what I suffer<br>
                    No they don't know, so keep your thoughts<br>
                    And stop assuming that, someone is always fine<br>
                    If you think I'm such a happy person, no<br>
